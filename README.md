## Overview

In this project, you'll apply data visualization skills using **Matplotlib** to analyze a pharmaceutical company's clinical trial data. The data relates to the effectiveness of drug regimens for treating **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**, a common form of skin cancer. The study tracks the tumor development in 249 mice over 45 days using various drug treatments, with a focus on the drug **Capomulin**.

## Objective

As a senior data analyst at **Pymaceuticals, Inc.**, your task is to analyze the clinical study data and generate plots and tables for a technical report. You'll also provide a high-level summary of the results.

## Tasks

1. **Prepare the data**: Clean and organize the dataset for analysis.
2. **Generate summary statistics**: Calculate key statistics for the dataset, including mean, median, and standard deviation.
3. **Create bar and pie charts**: Visualize the distribution of drug regimens and gender of the mice.
4. **Calculate quartiles and outliers**: Perform statistical analysis on tumor volume data and create a box plot to display outliers.
5. **Create line and scatter plots**: Visualize tumor volume trends and analyze the relationship between variables.
6. **Correlation and regression analysis**: Calculate the correlation and regression between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
7. **Final analysis**: Provide a top-level summary of the findings.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Pandas**
- **Scipy**

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to generate the plots and tables.
4. Review the final analysis summary for insights from the clinical study.

## Summary

This analysis provides insights into the performance of the drug **Capomulin** compared to other treatments, identifying key findings such as tumor size reduction and treatment effectiveness across different regimens. The results will be used for reporting to the executive team and guiding future studies.
